# Mosquitto_Client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trongvu/Mosquitto_Client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trongvu/Mosquitto_Client)
This application is demostration for [Mosquitto Library](https://github.com/trongvu/Mosquitto_TLS_Android) with my modification.  
It supports basic functions: subscribe & publish message.  
TLS connection also can be used if needed.  
[EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus) was used inside.
